# Sending IPs

When sending messages via Enveloop, you can have customers add the following IP range to increase deliverability. In most cases, **it's not necessary**, but in the event that some systems you are attempting to send into have very strict policies, you can encourage system administrators to add the following IPs to their _allowlist_.&#x20;

### Enveloop Sending IPs:
The range of IPs for Enveloop sending are:
`23.251.226.0/28`
