Amazon SES is a cloud-based email service provider that enables you to send and receive emails using your own email addresses and domains. If you are using your own Amazon SES account, you can use the SMTP settings to configure Enveloop to send emails using this account.

Here's how:

#### Step 1: Setup Amazon SES SMTP Credentials
After logging into your Amazon SES account, navigate to the **SMTP settings** page in the left navigation.
![Amazon SES SMTP Settings](/docs-images/amazon-ses-smtp-settings.png)

After clicking, you will see a button allowing you to setup credentials for SMTP. Click the button to create a new set of credentials.

Follow the instructions and be sure to copy the assigned **Username** and **Password** as you will need these in the next steps and they will not be shown again.

#### Step 2: Configure your SMTP Provider

You will need the **Username** and **Password** from Step 1 as well as the **SMTP endpoint** found on the **SMTP settings** page (ex: `email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`)

Now that you have the SMTP credentials created inside of Amazon SES, return to the Enveloop app and follow the [steps on the SMTP setup](/integrations/email-integrations/smtp/adding-smtp-to-enveloop) to configure the provider in Enveloop using the following settings:

* Host: **\<SMTP endpoint>**
* User: **\<Username from Step 1>**
* Pass: **\<Password from Step 1>**

#### Step 3: Add your "Default From"

Your Default From Email is a global setting that defines the email address and identity that will deliver the messages sent by Enveloop by default. Once complete, click **Save Integration**.
