# Creating a Verified Sender

We've discussed [sending messages using any email address on a domain name](../getting-started/adding-a-sending-domain.html), so let's take a look at another option -- a more _scoped_ approach to sending that's available to you.

### Why set up a Verified Sender?

So, why would you want to use a **Verified Sender** vs. a Domain Name?&#x20;

A verified sender is a great option for:

* Using Enveloop to send messages when you do not control or have access to your domain name.
* You want to test out Enveloop and aren't ready to add settings to your domain record. _(It's cool â€“ we totally understand!)_

Let's take a brief moment to look at how this works!

### Starting the Process <a href="#adding-a-verified-sender" id="adding-a-verified-sender"></a>

After logging into Enveloop, go the **Mail Settings**, located in the left-side navigation, for the team/project you want to add a sender to.

Once in mail settings, click on the **Add Sender ID** button.

After that, you'll be prompted to enter the email address you want to send from. Once added, click the **Add Sender ID** button.

### Check your Inbox

Now, Enveloop will send you an email to that address, starting the process of verifying your access for sending.

Until you verify the email, you will note that Enveloop shows as having an incomplete setup or a **Yellow shield**.

### Verified!

Once the email address has been verified, you'll see a **Green Shield** icon. Now, you are all set to start sending.

Pretty straight-forward! Now you are all set to start sending email, using Enveloop, on that verified email address.
