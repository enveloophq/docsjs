# âœ‰ Google Domain SMTP Relay

You can read more about Google SMTP Relay in their docs:

[https://support.google.com/a/answer/2956491?hl=en](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2956491?hl=en)

Enveloop will be launching full support for Google OAuth for SMTP soon.

### Step 1: Create an App password on Google for Enveloop.

You will not be able to log in with your normal Google password. For security, you will need to set up an **App Password** and will use this password to authenticate Enveloop to Google. Go to your [Google account security page](https://myaccount.google.com/security) and create a new **App password.**

## **Step 2: Configure SMTP Relay settings**

Goto your [Google Admin Routing Settings](https://admin.google.com/u/1/ac/apps/gmail/routing) and click **"Add Another Rule"** beside **SMTP Relay Service**.

Under **1. Allowed Senders** chose **"Only addresses in my domains"**

Under **2. Authentication** chose **"Require SMTP Authentication"**

### **Step 3: Configure your SMTP Provider**

Follow the [steps on the SMTP setup](./#adding-smtp-to-enveloop) to configure the provider in Enveloop using the following settings:

* Host: **smtp-relay.gmail.com**
* User: **\<your google hosted email address>**
* Pass: **\<App password from step 1>**

### Step 3: Add your "Default From"

Your Default From Email is a global setting that defines the email address and identity that will deliver the message by default. Once complete, click **Save Integration**.

When using Google SMTP Relay you can send emails as other users in the authed domain not just the logged in user.
