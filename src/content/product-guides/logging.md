When creating Enveloop, we wanted to re-imagine how email and text message logging. Efficiency & speed-to-answer was the primary focus.

As you start to use Enveloop logging, here are the key features we think you'll find useful.

### Live Logs / Pausing Logs

As you are watching message logs, all events show live: new messages being sent, message statuses changing, events happening. Plus, as you scroll, the logging will automatically pause while you look for a specific message. This way, you are not having results move around (when more logs come in) as you diagnose an issue.

Ready to resume logs to get the latest information? Simply click to the **Resume** button to return to live logging.

Along with the live or paused logging, we've included **infinite scrolling**. Clicking through page after page of pagination is slow drudgery. Along with powerful filtering, which we discuss next, you can quickly scroll to what you are looking for in the logs.

### Filtering

While you can easily scroll and scan logs to find messages you are looking for, filtering remains a highly important tool for limiting all your messages to a manageable set.

For all the various properties of the messages you have, use the Filtering tool in the logs to limit down log entries. You can use this both with live and paused log views. Filter logging based on:

* Message Type
* Message Status (queued, sent, failed, etc.)
* Date & Date Range
* Actions (open, clicked, etc.)
* Who it was sent to
* Who it was sent from
* Message Template used

### Event Tracking

When using Enveloop Logging, you can track all the events that have occurred on a message -- for example: if a message has been queued, sent, or delivered. Also, you can see user interactions, such as if a message has been opened, clicked, or if a user has yet to do anything with a message.

### Message Timeline & Response

When you want to view more detail on a specific message, you can select it and an array of information will be provided to you, including the timeline of all events for the message and all responses in JSON format.

### Rendered Customer View

Often, as you are supporting your customers, what you need to see is "How did this message look to the person I am helping?"

Enveloop makes that part easy. For all the messages that you send, you can easily see the rendered version of the message that was sent to a specific recipient. This lets you know if an email or text was sent correctly and allows you to reference specific areas of the message when providing support to your users/customers.

Enveloop also includes a **Plain Text** option -- allowing you to ensure that your messages look best all the various ways they may be displayed.

### Variable Payloads

Along with a rendered customer view, you can also quickly view the data payload, in JSON format, that was sent to the Enveloop API when you made your original message call. This allows you to confirm data outside of all the content and design of a message.
